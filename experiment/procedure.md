### Procedure

* This simulation teaches you 4 exceptions one-by-one.
* To select which exception you want to learn, use the dropbox in the leftmost box.
* We have two parts in every experiment - 
    1. Generate an Exception - Learn how a user can generate an exception to avoid how to make those mistakes yourself. If you enter an input that does not generate an exception press `Try Again` to reload the page and reset the animation. Try to make the yellow ball jump to check if you have correctly generated an exception.
    2. Applications of Exception Handling - This section actually teaches you how to write code that handles exceptions and can do all kinds of real world applications safely without generating exceptions.
